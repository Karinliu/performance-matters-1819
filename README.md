## Scripts
For my project I have used one npm script: [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon).

Nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.

To install Nodemon, I did the following steps:

1. `npm i nodemon`
2. Go to `package.json` and add a JSON config command line. For example what I have in my scripts: `dev": "nodemon app.js`
3. After you have added this line in your package.json you can run it with your terminal with the following command: `npm run dev`.
